# Instacart Analysis

# Objective
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, has very good sales but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation. Instacart wants to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. The analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.

# Key Questions
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ.
